# myBus
Simple Chrome extension using the NextBus API

This extension calls the nextBus API everytime it is clicked on and retrieves the time left for 
two particular stops of Gold1 and Gold2 right now. (for my use case)

## To Do

* Allow users to choose the routes of fairfax via the options page.
* Store user oprions to the extension.
